galaxy-lint-rules
=================

This repository contains custom [Ansible Lint rules](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-lint) that will be used by [the Galaxy server](https://galaxy.ansible.com), starting in version 3.1 (under development), and a yet to be determined future release of [Mazer, the new Galaxy CLI](https://github.com/ansible/mazer), to evaluate Ansible content. Initially started with ansible-lint rules from [ansible-lint](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-lint), [ansible-review](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-review), and [tsukinowasha/ansible-lint-rules](https://github.com/tsukinowasha/ansible-lint-rules).
