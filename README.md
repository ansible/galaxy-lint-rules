# galaxy-lint-rules

This repository contains custom [Ansible Lint rules](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-lint) that will be used by [the Galaxy server](https://galaxy.ansible.com), starting in version 3.1 (under development), and a yet to be determined future release of [Mazer, the new Galaxy CLI](https://github.com/ansible/mazer), to evaluate Ansible content.
